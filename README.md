In this project, I implement 4 different algorithms to solve k-median and k-center with outliers problems and analyze their performance.

There are 7 instances available to test algorithms. The source of
these instances is http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/. 

The file format is as follows. The first line is ‘k v’, where ‘v’ is the value of input k. The next line is ‘m v’, where ‘v’ is the value of
input m (for k-mean ignore the value m). Then each remaining line consists of a set of coordinates ‘x1 x2’, which stand for the coordinates for one input point in P.

The output file should have the same name as the input file with the ending .sol
